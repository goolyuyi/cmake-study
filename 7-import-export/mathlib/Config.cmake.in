# The `check_required_components` helper macro ensures that all requested, non-optional components have been found by
# checking the <Package>_<Component>_FOUND variables for all required components.
# This macro should be called at the end of the package configuration file even if the package does not have any components.
# This way, CMake can make sure that the downstream project hasn't specified any non-existent components.

# The `set_and_check()` macro should be used in configuration files instead of the normal set() command for
# setting directories and file locations. If a referenced file or directory does not exist, the macro will fail.
